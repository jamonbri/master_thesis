The `project` folder contains the model files:
- `model`: folder containing the model, agents and model data handling scripts
- `data`: folder containing pre-processing scripts and datasets (ignored by `.gitignore` because of file size)
The rest of the files are Jupyter notebook for running the simulations and analyzing the results
