The `project` folder contains the model files:
- `model`: folder containing the model, agents and model data handling scripts
- `data`: folder containing pre-processing scripts and datasets (ignored by `.gitignore` because of file size)
- `model_simulation.py`: script for running the model and analyzing the results
- `run.py`: additional script for executing a simulation from the console
